## Elegant Blur Background
### Project Description

The purpose of this mini project is to create a responsive, elegant opening web page with a blurring effect.

This project was first built by following Traversy Media's YouTube tutorial and customized by adding a personal touch with a cooking theme. The blurring effects were created using pseudo-elements and the webkit-filter property in CSS.
